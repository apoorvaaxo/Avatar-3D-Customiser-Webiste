# 3D Swag Customization App

## Overview

Our 3D Swag Customization App leverages React.js and Three.js for immersive 3D personalization. Users can interactively rotate and zoom their swag items for a realistic preview. Key features include:

- Extensive color customization.
- Seamless integration of custom logos into 3D models.
- AI-generated designs from OpenAI for unique patterns.

Built on React.js, the app ensures a responsive interface across devices. Performance is optimized with Vite and React Three Fiber for fast loading and smooth 3D rendering. We foster a community-focused approach with an active Discord community for collaboration and feedback. Security and scalability are addressed with Node.js and Express.js.

Whether for personal, promotional, or business use, our app provides a versatile platform for digital creativity, setting new standards in virtual swag customization.

## User Interface

1. **‘Customize It’ Button:**
   - Users are encouraged to start customizing their swag with a prominent "Customize It" button.

2. **AI Picker Component:**
   - Within the AI Picker tab, users can input prompts to generate AI-designed patterns or logos. Options to select AI-generated designs for both logos and full textures are included.

3. **Color Picker Component:**
   - The Color Picker tab allows users to select colors using a SketchPicker component. Changes in color are immediately reflected in the 3D swag preview for real-time feedback.

4. **File Picker Component:**
   - In the File Picker tab, users can upload images to be integrated as logos or textures onto the swag items. It offers options to upload either a logo or a full texture image for customization.

5. **Interactive Tabs and Buttons:**
   - Interactive tabs and buttons facilitate seamless navigation and action triggers, allowing users to switch between editor tabs and filter tabs effortlessly.

## Purpose

Our project aims to revolutionize digital swag customization by providing a user-friendly platform where anyone can create personalized swag items. Technologies like React.js and Three.js enable an interactive 3D environment where users can easily customize swag items, such as shirts, with various colors and uploaded logos. 

The app offers realistic previews of designs from different angles, enhancing the customization experience. Integration with OpenAI provides advanced AI features for generating unique designs and patterns, allowing users to unleash their creativity beyond traditional customization options.

Our goal is to ensure the app is accessible and easy to use across different devices, providing a hassle-free customization process for everyone.
